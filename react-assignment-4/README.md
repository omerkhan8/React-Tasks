## React class Assignment 4:

Let's develop a simple app to understand working of Props in React.
Use these images:
brokenBulb = https://media.istockphoto.com/vectors/brokendown-light-bulb-vector-id164446736
bulb = https://www.industrytap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/incandescent-e1456179151174.jpg
lightBulb = https://img.purch.com/w/660/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5saXZlc2NpZW5jZS5jb20vaW1hZ2VzL2kvMDAwLzAwMi83NTkvb3JpZ2luYWwvMDgxMjA5LWxpZ2h0LWJ1bGItMDIuanBn 

Develop 4 components.
1) Should show a Bulb Image (default: bulb) depending on the main component's state.
2) Should show a `Switch On` button, on pressing it, the first component should show lightBulb image.
3) Should show a `Switch Off` button, on pressing it, the first component should show bulb image.
4) Should show a `Break The Bulb` button, on pressing it, the first component should show brokenBulb image.
